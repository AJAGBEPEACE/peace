            <p>Well, it all starts with a 3-week Google Technical Immersion(GTI) program. It’s the very first thing every new hire goes through before working with their actual team. All the new hires in APAC region fly to Singapore for an exciting 3 weeks event. But, it has been made virtual for quite some time now, courtesy COVID. Here, you & a small Noogler team work on a project using Google’s tools, processes and methodologies. <br> <br>
                After getting my Noogler hat & the successful completion of GTI, I joined 
                Google Cloud
                 organisation and my onboarding was virtual. It took me some time to get acquainted with the cool “Google infrastructure” and honestly the first few weeks were quite overwhelming. Nevertheless, my team mates were supportive and helped me settle in. I really appreciate how everyone here respects Google’s values. <br> <br>
                 If you’re in the same boat, give yourself some time and things will start making sense. You’ll get sufficient time for onboarding and everyone around you will be happy to help! Don’t hesitate to ask.
